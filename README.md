### Hi there 👋
My name is Cleolyn, but just call me "Cleo".
I'm currently attending Northern Illinois University for a B.S. in Computer Science.
I went down the university route because I had no prior experience in programming and
didn't know where to start. I'm looking to build my profile so any feedback or advice
are very much welcome!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my B.S. in Computer Science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures & Algorithm/Network Programming
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate if an opportunity arises.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with pretty much everything. Feedbacks are welcome!
- Fun Fact: I enjoy playing video games, I have a dog named Yoda, and a 5 year old.
