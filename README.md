### Hi there 👋
My name is Cleolyn, but just call me 'Cleo'.
I'm currently attending Northern Illinois University for a B.S. in Computer Science.
I went down the university route because I had no prior experience in programming and
no idea where to start. I'm looking to build my profile so any feedback or advice
are very much welcome!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my B.S. in Computer Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently a Senior in Northern Illinois University.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate if an opportunity arises.
- 🤔 Any help appreciated. Feedbacks are welcome!
