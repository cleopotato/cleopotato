### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Cleolyn, but just call me 'Cleo'.
I'm currently attending Northern Illinois University for a B.S. in Computer Science.
I went down the university route because I had no prior experience in programming and
no idea where to start. I'm looking to build my profile so any feedback or advice
are very much welcome!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my B.S. in Computer Science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Senior in Northern Illinois University.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate if an opportunity arises.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with pretty much everything. Feedbacks are welcome!
